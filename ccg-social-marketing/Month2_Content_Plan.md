## Week 1: The "Problem Solver" (Feb 2 - 6)
*Focus: You fix the headaches other agencies create.*

### 📅 Monday, Feb 2
**Topic**: The Maze (Simplification)
**Visual**: ![Maze](assets/ccg_problem_solution_maze_1769729385720.png)
**Copy**:
Stop paying for "hosting complications."

Running a plumbing business is hard. Your website shouldn't be.
Most agencies give you a tangled mess of DNS records, hosting fees, and plugin updates.
We give you a straight line to revenue.
One fee. One call. Done.

**Copy**:
Time is money. We save both.

In the time it takes other agencies to "send a proposal," we launch your site.
7 Days. That's our standard.
Because every day you wait is a lead your competitor gets.

## Week 2: Niche Dominance (Feb 9 - 13)
*Focus: You know the Trades better than anyone.*

### 📅 Monday, Feb 9
**Topic**: Mobile Reality

**Copy**:
Built for the job site, not the desk.

Your customers aren't sitting at iMacs. They are searching for "Emergency Electrician" on a cracked iPhone screen while standing in a flooded basement.
If your buttons aren't HUGE and your text clear, you lost them.
We build for the field.
