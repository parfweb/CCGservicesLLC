## Post 2: Local SEO Power (Wednesday)
**Goal**: Education
**Visual**: *[Insert SEO Chart or Map Visual]*

**LinkedIn Copy**:
Honest question: 👇

Pull out your phone. Open Google Maps.
Search for your service in your neighborhood (e.g., "Plumber Brooklyn").

Points for honesty:
1. Did you show up in the top 3?
2. Or did you have to scroll past 5 competitors?

If you had to scroll, you just found out why your phone isn't ringing.
Local SEO isn't magic. It's structure. And we build it into every site we launch.

Want to rank? Let's talk.

## Post 3: Portfolio Spotlight (Friday)
**Goal**: Social Proof (Case Study style)
**Visual**: *[Insert Clean Salon Portfolio Image]*

**LinkedIn Copy**:
This salon was great at styling.
But terrible at booking. 💇‍♀️

They had loyal clients, but new customers couldn't figure out how to make an appointment online. They just clicked away.

We fixed it with one change:
A friction-free "Book Appointment" button that follows you down the page.

Bookings went up. Frustration went down.
Sometimes you don't need a rebrand. You just need a button that works.

Check out this build for a local salon brand.

"I wish I did this sooner." ✨
That's what this salon owner said after we launched their new booking-friendly site.
Your website should make your life easier, not harder.
