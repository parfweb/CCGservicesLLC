**Summary Type**: "What We Do" Briefing

## 🎙️ The "Audio Overview" Script (Concept)
*Host 1*: "So we fed this local agency, CCG SiteSpark, into the system to see what they're actually selling. And it's not just websites."
*Host 2*: "Right, it's more like... digital real estate for tradespeople?"
*Host 1*: "Exactly. The big takeaway here is **Speed** and **Friction Removal**. They aren't trying to build art galleries; they're building lead traps for Plumbers and Electricians."

## 🔑 Key Points (The Core 4)
According to the source, here is exactly **What We Do**:

1.  **Hyper-Niche Specialization**
    *   We don't do restaurants. We don't do blogs.
    *   We build for **Service Businesses** (HVAC, Plumbing, Construction) where the "emergency call" is the goal.

2.  **The "7-Day Sprint"**
    *   Most agencies take 6-12 weeks.
    *   CCG SiteSpark deploys fully functional sites in **7 Days**.
    *   *Why it matters*: Contractors lose money every day they aren't online.

3.  **Mobile-First Conversion**
    *   The analysis shows a focus on "Thumb-Friendly" design.
    *   Sticky "Call Now" buttons.
    *   No pinch-and-zoom menus.
    *   *Stat*: 80% of trade searches happen on valuable mobile devices.

4.  **The $500 Entry Point**
    *   Removing the barrier to entry.
    *   High-end design accessibility for small local businesses.
    *   No massive upfront $5k fees.
