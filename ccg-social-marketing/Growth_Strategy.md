# CCG SiteSpark Growth Strategy: Beyond Posting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Posting content is passive. **Growth is active.**
> To grow your audience (and leads), you need an outbound "Engine".

## Phase 1: The "15-Minute" LinkedIn Routine
*Do this every single morning with your coffee.*

1.  **The "Target 10" (5 Mins)**
    *   Find 10 active profiles of your target client (e.g., "Owner of Plumbing Co", "General Contractor").
    *   **Action**: Comment on their *latest post*. Do not sell. Add value.
    *   *Example*: "Great point about supply chain delays, Mike. We're seeing the same with our remodeling clients."
2.  **The Connection Request (5 Mins)**
    *   Send 5-10 requests daily to local business owners.
    *   **Note**: "Hi [Name], saw you're operating out of Brooklyn. I build sites for local trades—just looking to connect with other real business owners here. Cheers."
3.  **The "Soft" DM (5 Mins)**
    *   Message new connections *only after they accept*.
    *   *Script*: "Thanks for connecting, [Name]. If you ever get tired of your current website not generating leads, let me know. I have a '7-Day Build' system specifically for [Industry]. Keep crushing it."

## Phase 2: Facebook Group Penetration
*Where the trades hang out.*

1.  **Join Local Groups**: "Brooklyn Small Business", "NYC Contractors", "Electricians Talk".
2.  **The "Help, Don't Sell" Method**:
    *   Search the group for keywords: "website", "marketing", "leads", "slow".
    *   **Comment**: "I run a web agency for trades. The reason your site is slow is huge images. Honest tip: run them through TinyPNG.com before uploading. It's free."
    *   *Result*: You establish Authority. They click your profile.

## Phase 3: The "Website Audit" Hook (Lead Magnet)
*Give them a reason to talk to you.*

*   **Offer**: "Free 5-Point Conversion Audit" (Video loom).
*   **Process**:
    1.  Find a bad contractor site on Google Maps (Page 2-3).
    2.  Record a 60-second Loom video: "Hey, I found you on Google. You're losing clicks because your phone number isn't clickable. Here's how to fix it..."
    3.  Email it to them: "Made you a quick video fixing 1 error."
    *   *Conversion Rate*: Extremely high.

## Phase 4: Strategic Partnerships
*Leverage other people's audiences.*

1.  **SEO Agencies**: Many do SEO but hate design. Offer to be their "White Label" design partner.
2.  **Business Coaches**: Connect with coaches for trades. Offer their clients a discount.
3.  **Print Shops**: Local shops that print business cards. Ask them to refer clients who need a website to match the card.
