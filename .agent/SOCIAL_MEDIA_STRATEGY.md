# CCG SiteSpark: Social Media Master Strategy
**Goal:** Generate 5-10 qualified leads per month from LinkedIn and Facebook by March 2026.

---

## Part 1: The Strategic Foundation

### Your Competitive Advantage
You are **NOT** competing with Wix, Squarespace, or Fiverr.  
You are competing with **the status quo** (businesses doing nothing or using terrible DIY sites).

**Your Message:**
> "We stop local service businesses from losing emergency jobs to competitors with outdated websites."

**Your Proof Points:**
1. Industry-specific demos (PlumberDemo, ElectricianDemo, etc.)
2. Local Brooklyn presence (721 Avenue U)
3. Speed to market (sites delivered in 7-14 days, not months)

🚀 Excited to officially launch CCG SiteSpark!

After watching too many great Brooklyn businesses lose jobs to "big box" competitors 
with better websites, we decided to do something about it.

We build high-converting websites specifically for:
✅ Plumbers (with 24/7 emergency lead capture)
✅ Electricians (license showcase & trust-building)
✅ Nail Salons (online booking that actually works)
✅ HVAC, Painters, Landscapers, & more

Follow along as we help local pros win back their market share.

Pop quiz for Brooklyn business owners: 🤔

When was the last time YOU visited your own website on your phone?

If it's been more than a month, there's a 70% chance something is broken 
(slow loading, broken contact form, or worse - it's not mobile-friendly).

80% of your customers are searching on their phone while standing in their 
broken kitchen with a leaking pipe.

If your site doesn't load in 3 seconds, they're calling your competitor.

SEO Truth Bomb for Service Businesses 💣

Having a website is NOT enough.

If you don't show up in the Google "Map Pack" (those 3 businesses with map pins 
at the top of search results), you might as well not exist.

Here's what gets you there:
1️⃣ Verified Google Business Profile
2️⃣ Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web
3️⃣ At least 10 real Google reviews
4️⃣ A website that loads in under 3 seconds
5️⃣ Location-specific keywords (not just "plumber" but "Brooklyn plumber")

We specialize in getting NYC service businesses into that Map Pack.

Question: How many of you are currently tracking your Google rankings?

**Type:** Visual Proof (Demo Screenshot)  
**Post:**
```
Real talk: Your website has ONE job ☝️

Make it stupid-easy for customers to call you.

Here's a feature we build into every plumber website:

👉 A sticky "Emergency Call" bar that follows the user as they scroll  
👉 One-click calling (no copy-paste nonsense)  
👉 Visible even at 2 AM when pipes burst

Simple? Yes.  
Effective? A client saw 40% more inbound calls in the first month.

📸 Screenshot attached showing the actual mobile interface.

What features do YOU think a service business website MUST have?

Friday morning coffee at L&B Spumoni Gardens ☕🍕

Finishing up a website audit for a local electrician while the Sicilian 
slice is in the oven. This is the life.

Quick shoutout to all the Brooklyn business owners grinding this week.

We see you. We support you. And we're here when you're ready to take 
your online presence to the next level.

Enjoy your weekend! 🛠️

### **Saturday, Jan 25 (LinkedIn Only)**
**Type:** Link Share + Mini Case Study  
**Post:**
```
Why do "standard" website templates fail service businesses? 🤔

Because a plumber's needs are NOTHING like a yoga studio's needs.

When someone's basement is flooding at 11 PM, they don't care about 
your "brand story" or "design philosophy."

They need:
- Your phone number (clickable)
- Proof you're licensed
- Service area coverage
- Reviews from real neighbors

We built industry-specific page templates that convert 3x better than 
generic Wix/Squarespace sites.

### **Sunday, Jan 26 (REST DAY)**
**Activity:** 
- Spend 30 minutes joining 5 Facebook Groups:
  - "Brooklyn Business Networking"
  - "NYC Contractors & Handymen"
  - "Queens Small Business Network"
  - "New York Property Managers"
  - "Long Island Home Services"

---

## Part 4: Engagement Tactics (Daily Actions)

### LinkedIn (15 mins/day)
1. **Search:** `Owner OR Founder` in `Construction, Plumbing, HVAC` within `50 miles of Brooklyn, NY`
2. **Connect:** Send 5 personalized connection requests:
   ```
   Hey [Name], I help Brooklyn-area [Industry] businesses get more leads online. 
   Always connecting with local business owners. Looking forward to your content!
   ```
3. **Engage:** Comment on 3 posts from your target audience. Be helpful, not salesy.

### Facebook (10 mins/day)
1. **Join Groups:** Request to join 1 new local business group per week.
2. **Engage:** Comment on 2 posts in your groups. Answer questions if possible.
3. **Share Value:** Once per week, post a "Free Tip" in a group (not your page).

---

## Part 5: Success Metrics (Track Weekly)

### Leading Indicators (Activity):
- [ ] 3 LinkedIn posts published
- [ ] 4 Facebook posts published
- [ ] 25 new LinkedIn connections
- [ ] 10 meaningful comments on other posts
- [ ] 1 Facebook group post

### Lagging Indicators (Results):
- Website clicks from social (check GA4 Traffic Acquisition)
- Profile views (LinkedIn Analytics / Facebook Insights)
- Inbound messages/connection requests
- Contact form submissions mentioning "saw your post"

**Goal:** By Week 4, you should see 50-100 website clicks per week from social.

---

## Part 6: The "Sniper Strategy" (High-Value Targets)

Don't just post and pray. **Actively hunt.**

### Step 1: Identify the Whale
See a post from a general contractor saying: *"Looking for reliable subs in Brooklyn"*

### Step 2: Provide Value First
Comment: *"I work with a few great electricians in the area. Happy to make intros if helpful."*

### Step 3: The DM (24 hours later)
```
Hey [Name], saw your post about finding reliable subs. I actually run a web 
design shop that works exclusively with contractors and trades in NYC.

Not a sales pitch—just wanted to say if you ever need intros to licensed pros 
I've worked with, always happy to connect. 

Also, if your GC company ever needs help with its online presence (website, 
Google rankings, etc.), that's our wheelhouse. Either way, good luck with the project!
```

**Why this works:** You gave value first (introductions), THEN mentioned your service.

---

## Part 7: Content Swipe File (Steal These)

### "Money Leak" Posts:
1. "If your website doesn't have an SSL certificate (the 🔒 in the browser), Google is hiding you from search results."
2. "Spending $500/month on Facebook ads but your website has a broken contact form? You're flushing money down the drain."
3. "Not showing up when people Google '[Your Business] Brooklyn'? Your competitor is eating your lunch."

### "Engagement Bait" Posts:
1. "Pop quiz: What's the #1 feature a plumber's website MUST have? Wrong answers only. 😂"
2. "Finish this sentence: 'The worst website mistake I ever made was...'"
3. "Show of hands: Who built their own website and regrets it? (No judgment, we've all been there.)"

### "Authority" Posts:
1. "Just set up Google Search Console for a client. They had 247 pages indexed that didn't exist. Google hates that. Here's how to fix it..."
2. "Fun fact: 60% of local service searches happen AFTER 6 PM. Is your website ready for those late-night emergency calls?"

---

## Part 8: When to Pivot

If after 30 days you haven't seen:
- At least 1 meaningful conversation in DMs
- At least 50 website clicks from social
- At least 5 positive reactions per post

**Then adjust:**
- Try video content (30-second screen recordings of your demos)
- Join different Facebook groups
- Test posting at different times
- Go MORE visual (infographics, before/after screenshots)

---

## TLDR: Your Weekly Workflow

**Monday Morning (30 mins):**
- Write 3 LinkedIn posts + 4 Facebook posts for the week
- Schedule them in Meta Business Suite / LinkedIn native scheduler

**Daily (15 mins):**
- Engage: Comment on 5 posts
- Connect: Send 5 LinkedIn requests
- Check: Who viewed your profile? Send a follow-up DM.

**Friday Afternoon (20 mins):**
- Check Google Analytics: Which posts drove traffic?
- Adjust next week's content based on what worked.

**That's it. Social media is a marathon, not a sprint.**

**Last Word of Wisdom:**  
You don't need 10,000 followers. You need 10 plumbers in Brooklyn who trust you. Focus on quality, not vanity metrics.
