🚀 Launching CCG SiteSpark: A New Approach to Service Business Marketing

After watching too many great Brooklyn plumbers, electricians, and local pros lose jobs to "big box" competitors with better websites, I decided to do something about it.

Here's the problem:

A homeowner's pipe bursts at 11 PM. They Google "emergency plumber Brooklyn." Your competitor's site loads in 2 seconds. Yours takes 8 seconds. Guess who gets the call?

Or worse: Their phone number is clickable. Yours isn't. They just lost you $500.

I'm building CCG SiteSpark to fix this exact problem—industry-specific websites that turn local searches into paying customers.

Following along as we help Brooklyn's best service pros win back their market share.

Why? Because I've watched too many amazing Brooklyn plumbers and electricians lose jobs to competitors who just had better Google rankings.

Our specialty: Websites for service pros (plumbers, electricians, HVAC, nail salons, etc.)

## Next Week's Content (Pre-Planning)

### LinkedIn Post #2 (Scheduled for Thursday, Jan 23 @ 12:00 PM):
**Theme:** "The Problem Exposure" (from the strategy doc)

**Draft:**
```
I tested 50 Brooklyn plumber websites last week. 🔍

42 of them had this fatal flaw: Their phone number wasn't clickable on mobile.

Think about it:
- Homeowner's basement is flooding
- They Google "emergency plumber Brooklyn"
- Your site comes up
- They tap your phone number... nothing happens
- They hit "Back" and call your competitor

You just lost a $500 job because of 3 lines of HTML code.

Want to check if YOUR site has this issue? Reply with your website and I'll run a free 60-second mobile test.

### Facebook Post #2 (Scheduled for Friday, Jan 24 @ 5:30 PM):
**Theme:** "Local Community Value"

**Draft:**
```
Pop quiz for Brooklyn business owners: 🤔

When was the last time YOU visited your own website on your phone?

If it's been more than a month, there's a 70% chance something is broken.

Here's why this matters:

80% of your customers are searching on their phone while standing in their broken kitchen with a leaking pipe. If your site doesn't load in 3 seconds, they're calling your competitor.

Drop a 📱 if you want a free mobile site check. No catch, just helping out the neighborhood.
