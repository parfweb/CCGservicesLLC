# UTM Tracking Guide for CCG SiteSpark

## What is UTM Tracking?
UTM parameters are tags added to URLs to track where your website traffic comes from. Google Analytics automatically reads these and shows you which social posts, ads, or campaigns drive the most traffic.

## URL Builder Template

Use this pattern for all social media posts:

```
https://ccgsitespark.com/[PAGE]?utm_source=[SOURCE]&utm_medium=[MEDIUM]&utm_campaign=[CAMPAIGN]
```

### Parameter Definitions:
- **utm_source**: Where the traffic comes from (e.g., `linkedin`, `facebook`, `instagram`)
- **utm_medium**: The type of traffic (e.g., `social`, `email`, `cpc`)
- **utm_campaign**: The specific campaign name (e.g., `jan2026_launch`, `plumber_outreach`)

## How to Check Results in Google Analytics

1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Navigate to: **Reports** → **Acquisition** → **Traffic acquisition**
3. Look for rows labeled:
   - `facebook / social`
   - `linkedin / social`
4. Click on the row to see:
   - How many users came from that source
   - How long they stayed on your site
   - Which pages they visited

## Pro Tip: Campaign Naming
Change `jan2026` to something more specific as you run different campaigns:
- `jan2026_launch` (Your initial posts)
- `feb2026_plumber_focus` (Month focused on plumber outreach)
- `q1_electrician_push` (Quarter 1 electrician campaign)

This lets you compare which campaigns work best over time.
