🚀 Launching CCG SiteSpark: A New Approach to Service Business Marketing

After watching too many great Brooklyn plumbers, electricians, and local pros lose jobs to "big box" competitors with better websites, I decided to do something about it.

Here's the problem:

A homeowner's pipe bursts at 11 PM. They Google "emergency plumber Brooklyn." Your competitor's site loads in 2 seconds. Yours takes 8 seconds. Guess who gets the call?

Or worse: Their phone number is clickable. Yours isn't. They just lost you $500.

I'm building CCG SiteSpark to fix this exact problem—industry-specific websites that turn local searches into paying customers.

Following along as we help Brooklyn's best service pros win back their market share.

What's the #1 thing YOUR website should do better? Drop a comment—I'll reply with a free tip.

Big news from Avenue U! 🎉

I just launched CCG SiteSpark—a web design shop that's a little different.

Instead of building "pretty websites," we build websites that actually get you more calls.

Why? Because I've watched too many amazing Brooklyn plumbers and electricians lose jobs to competitors who just had better Google rankings.

Our specialty: Websites for service pros (plumbers, electricians, HVAC, nail salons, etc.)

If you've ever Googled your own business and been frustrated by what you saw... we should talk.

Follow along as we help local businesses crush it online! 🛠️

I tested 50 Brooklyn plumber websites last week. 🔍

42 of them had this fatal flaw: Their phone number wasn't clickable on mobile.

Think about it:
• Homeowner's basement is flooding
• They Google "emergency plumber Brooklyn"
• Your site comes up
• They tap your phone number... nothing happens
• They hit "Back" and call your competitor

You just lost a $500 job because of 3 lines of HTML code.

The worst part? Most business owners don't even know this is happening.

Here's a free test: Open your website on your phone right now. Try tapping your phone number. Does it work?

If not, you're bleeding money.

Pop quiz for Brooklyn business owners: 🤔

When was the last time YOU visited your own website on your phone?

If it's been more than a month, there's a 70% chance something is broken.

Here's why this matters:

80% of your customers are searching on their phone while standing in their broken kitchen with a leaking pipe. If your site doesn't load in 3 seconds, they're calling your competitor.

This weekend, I'm offering free 60-second mobile site checks.

Drop a 📱 emoji if you want me to test yours. No catch, just helping out the neighborhood.

Saturday morning workflow ☕

Working on a new site for a local electrician today. Instead of the usual "About Us, Services, Contact" template, we're focusing heavily on the "Emergency Service" button.

Why?

Because when someone's power goes out at 9 PM on a Saturday, nobody wants to read a company history. They need help NOW.

This is the difference between a $500 Wix template and a conversion-focused service business website.

One is built for aesthetics. The other is built for results.

Anyone else working on client projects this weekend?

Sunday thoughts 💭

Grabbed breakfast at [Local Cafe Name - you fill in] this morning and started thinking about all the amazing small businesses that make Brooklyn what it is.

The plumber who shows up at midnight when your pipes freeze.
The electrician who fits you in on a holiday.
The nail salon that remembers your name.

These businesses are the backbone of our community. And a lot of them are losing customers to chains simply because their websites don't show up on Google.

That's what CCG SiteSpark is here to fix.

Shoutout to all the local business owners grinding this weekend. You're the real MVPs.

## Week 2: The Educator (Jan 28 - Feb 3, 2026)

### Post 7: LinkedIn  
**Date:** Tuesday, Jan 28 @ 8:30 AM  
**Theme:** Educational (SEO 101)  
**Objective:** Teach without selling

**Text:**
```
The "Google Map Pack" is worth more than $100,000/year to a local service business.

What is it?

When you Google "plumber near me," you see 3 businesses at the top with map pins. That's the Map Pack.

Here's the crazy part:
• Position #1 gets 30% of clicks
• Position #2 gets 15% of clicks  
• Position #3 gets 10% of clicks
• Everyone else gets scraps

For a Brooklyn plumber averaging $500/job, being #1 instead of #10 means an extra $100K in annual revenue.

How do you get there?

1. Verified Google Business Profile
2. 15+ real Google reviews
3. Fast-loading website (under 3 seconds)
4. Location-specific keywords on your site
5. Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across the web

This isn't theoretical. This is what we do every day.

Question: Where does YOUR business rank in the Map Pack? (Be honest, I won't judge.)

FREE TOOL ALERT 🚨

Want to know if your website is costing you money?

Google has a free tool called "PageSpeed Insights" that tells you exactly how fast your site loads on mobile.

Here's how to use it:
1. Go to: pagespeed.web.dev
2. Type in your website
3. Hit "Analyze"

If your score is:
✅ 90-100: You're golden
⚠️ 50-89: You're losing some customers
❌ 0-49: You're bleeding money

Most local businesses I test score 20-40. Ouch.

Try it right now and drop your score in the comments. Let's see who has the fastest site in Brooklyn! 🏆

### Post 9: LinkedIn  
**Date:** Thursday, Jan 30 @ 12:00 PM  
**Theme:** Myth-Busting (Contrarian)  
**Objective:** Get engagement through debate

**Text:**
```
Unpopular opinion: Wix and Squarespace are terrible for service businesses. 🔥

Here's why:

1. **SEO Limitations:** Their templates aren't optimized for "near me" searches.
2. **Speed Issues:** Average load time is 6-8 seconds. Google wants under 3.
3. **No Industry Focus:** A plumber needs different features than a yoga studio.
4. **Hidden Costs:** $20/month turns into $100/month once you add apps.

But the REAL problem?

They're built for DIY. Which means YOU (the business owner) are now a web designer, SEO expert, and copywriter.

When does running your actual business fit in?

I get it—$500 sounds cheaper than $3,000.

But if your DIY site costs you 5 customers/month, you just spent $2,500 to save $2,500.

That's not smart business.

Disagree? I'm open to debate. Drop your thoughts below.

**Theme:** Weekend Wisdom  
**Objective:** Inspirational + practical

"Build it and they will come" is the worst business advice ever.

Your website won't magically bring customers just because it exists.

You need:
• SEO (so Google shows you)
• Speed (so visitors don't bounce)
• Clear CTAs (so they know what to do)
• Trust signals (reviews, licenses, testimonials)
• Mobile optimization (because 80% are on phones)

This is what separates a $500 website from a $5,000/month revenue generator.

Most small businesses overspend on the wrong things:
❌ Fancy animations
❌ Stock photos  
❌ Long "About Us" pages

And underspend on the right things:
✅ Fast hosting
✅ Local SEO
✅ Conversion optimization

Your website is your 24/7 salesperson. Make sure it's actually selling.

What's the best investment YOU made in your business website?

Quick win to share 🎉

Last week, we made 3 simple changes to a local electrician's website:

1. Added a click-to-call button at the top
2. Optimized their Google Business Profile
3. Sped up page load from 7 seconds to 2 seconds

Result? 

7 new customer calls in the first 4 days.

The crazy part? We didn't change the design. We didn't add fancy features.

We just fixed the stuff that was costing them money.

This is what we mean by "conversion-focused" web design.

Who else is tired of pretty websites that don't bring in business?

Real data from a recent client project:

BEFORE:
• Google ranking: Page 3

• Bounce rate: 73%

AFTER (30 days):
• Google ranking: Top 3 (Map Pack)

What changed?

1. Added industry-specific keywords (not generic "services")

4. Optimized for "near me" searches

Cost: $3,200 one-time + $150/month hosting  
ROI: $9,500 in additional monthly revenue

This is the difference between a website and a revenue asset.

CLIENT SPOTLIGHT 🌟

Shoutout to [Client Name - Electrician] in Sheepshead Bay!

2 weeks ago, his website wasn't showing up on Google.
Today? He's #2 in the Map Pack for "electrician Brooklyn."

How we did it:
✅ Fixed his Google Business Profile
✅ Added customer reviews
✅ Optimized his site for mobile
✅ Added "emergency service" keywords

Now he's getting 3-5 calls/day instead of 3-5 calls/week.

This is what happens when you work with someone who actually understands your industry.

Congrats, [Name]! 🎉

The home services industry is about to get hit HARD by AI search.

Google's new AI Overviews means searchers will get answers WITHOUT clicking your website.

Example:

Old Google: "plumber brooklyn" → Shows 10 blue links  
New Google: "plumber brooklyn" → AI summary with 3 recommended businesses

If you're not in that top 3, you don't exist.

Here's what this means for local service businesses:

1. **Reviews Matter More:** AI pulls from highly-rated businesses  
2. **Speed Matters More:** AI favors fast-loading sites
3. **Expertise Matters More:** Your "About" page is now AI-searchable

The good news?

Most of your competitors aren't preparing for this.

If you optimize NOW, you'll dominate your market for the next 5 years.

Are you watching the AI shift? Drop your thoughts below.
