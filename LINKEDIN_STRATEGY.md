# CCG SiteSpark: LinkedIn Domination Strategy
## Target Audience: Home Service Businesses (Plumbers, HVAC, etc.)

### 1. The "Cash Flow" Profile Optimization
Your profile is your landing page. If it looks like a resume, you lose. If it looks like a solution, you win.

- **Headline:** `Web Design for Home Service Pros 🛠️ | I turn your website into a 24/7 Salesperson | No Tech Jargon.`
- **Profile Picture:** Professional but approachable. No suit and tie if you want to vibe with tradesmen. A nice polo or clean shirt works best.
- **Banner:** A split image. Left side: "Confusing Website". Right side: "Profitable Website". Text overlay: "Stop Losing Leads."
- **Featured Section:**
    - Link to `ccgsitespark.com`
    - A post with a video scrolling through your best demo (e.g., the HVAC one).

### 2. The Content Machine (3 Posts/Week)
Do not post "tech" news. Post about business growth.

**Type A: The "Money Leak" Post**
*   **Concept:** Explain a common mistake costing them money.
*   **Example:** "If your phone number isn't clickable on your website mobile view, you are losing 30% of your calls instantly. People are lazy. Make it easy for them to pay you."

**Type B: The "Visual Proof"**
*   **Concept:** Side-by-side comparison.
*   **Example:** "Here is what a $500 DIY website looks like vs a Professional Conversion Site. The difference isn't just 'pretty' - it's trust. Who would you let into your house to fix a pipe?"

**Type C: The "Behind the Scenes"**
*   **Concept:** Show you are real.
*   **Example:** "Working on a new site for a local electrician today. Focused heavily on the 'Emergency Service' button because when the lights go out, nobody wants to read an 'About Us' page. They need help NOW."

### 3. "Sniper" Outreach Routine (Daily)
Spend 20 mins a day. Do not spam.

1.  **Search:** `Owner` OR `Founder` in `Construction`, `Plumbing`, `Electrical`. filter by `Location: [Your Area]`.
2.  **Connect:** Send 10 connection requests/day.
    *   *Note:* "Hey [Name], I work with local home service businesses in [City] to help them get more jobs online. Connecting with other business owners in the area."
3.  **Engage:** If they post, comment on it. "Agreed, finding good apprentices is tough right now." (Be a human).
4.  **The "Value Drop":** After they accept, wait 2 days. Send a video DM (Loom) or a screenshot.
    *   "Hey [Name], welcome to my network. I happened to click your site link—took 2 seconds to load nicely on my phone. Good stuff. Catch you around." (Complimenting works wonders).
    *   OR if it's bad: "Hey [Name], noticed your site has a 'Not Secure' earning. Google hates that. Let me know if you need a tip on how to fix it quickly."

### 4. Moving to the Sale
When they reply asking for help:
1.  **Don't talk price yet.** Ask: "Are you getting many leads from the site currently?"
2.  **The Pivot:** "I recently built a system for a [Similar Trade] that increased their calls by 40%. It's pretty straightforward."
3.  **The Call:** "Open to a 10-min chat? I can show you exactly what I'd change on your site to get similar results."

### 5. LinkedIn "SEO"
*   List your services in your "About" section as keywords: `Plumber Web Design`, `Electrician SEO`, `Local Business Website`.
*   This helps people find YOU when they search "Web design for contractors".
