## 📅 The Monthly Calendar

### Week 1: Content Creation (The "New Stuff")
*   **Action:** Write and post 2 Blog Articles.
*   **Topic Strategy:** Answer questions their customers ask.
    *   *Plumber ex:* "Why is my water heater making noise?", "How to prevent frozen pipes in [City Name]".
*   **Pro Tip:** Use ChatGPT/Claude to write the draft, but YOU must add local flavor (mention local neighborhoods, landmarks).
*   **Deliverable:** 2 URLs live on their site.

### Week 2: Google Business Profile (The "Local Signals")
*   **Action:** Log into their Google Business Profile.
*   **Post:** Upload 3-5 photos (ask client to text you photos of recent jobs). Even ugly photos of pipes/wires prove they are working!
*   **Update:** Add an "Update" post on Google Maps: "Providing emergency plumbing services in [Neighborhood] this week! Call us."
*   **Reviews:** Reply to any new reviews. Use keywords in the reply ("Thanks for hiring us for your *water heater repair*...").

### Week 3: Backlinks & Citations (The "Authority")
*   **Action:** Build 1-2 profile links.
*   **Easy Wins:**
    *   Create a profile on Houzz, Yelp, YellowPages (if they don't have one).
    *   Post on their Facebook/LinkedIn linking back to the Week 1 articles.
    *   *Advanced:* Find a local directory (e.g., "[City] Chamber of Commerce") and see if you can get listed.

### Week 4: The Report (The "Retention Tool")
*   **Action:** Send the Monthly Success Report.
*   **Why:** If you don't tell them what you did, they think you did nothing.
